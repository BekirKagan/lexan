# lexan

**lexan** is a lightweight C logging library that provides easy-to-use logging macros for different log levels, including **debug, info, warn, error,** and **fatal**. Logs are printed to **stdout** with colors for better readability.

## Features
- Simple **logging macros**: `LEX_LOG_DEBUG`, `LEX_LOG_INFO`, `LEX_LOG_WARN`, `LEX_LOG_ERROR`, `LEX_LOG_FATAL`
- **Color-coded output** for better log visibility
- Lightweight and **dependency-free**
- Built as a **static library**
- **CMake** support for easy integration

## Installation

## Example:

The **examples** folder contains sample implementations demonstrating how to integrate **lexan** into your project.

### Example Usage in Code:

```c
#include <lexan/lex_logger.h>

int main() {
    lex_logger_init(); // Required only on Windows.
    LEX_LOG_DEBUG("%s\n", "This is a debug log.");
    LEX_LOG_INFO("%s\n", "This is an info log.");
    LEX_LOG_WARN("%s\n", "This is a warn log.");
    LEX_LOG_ERROR("%s\n", "This is an error log.");
    LEX_LOG_FATAL("%s\n", "This is a fatal log.");
